# Archer TP-Link Router Local Remote Command Execution Exploit (CVE-2023-31756)

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates a local remote command execution vulnerability within the Archer TP-Link VR1600V V1/V2 routers. The exploit allows for administrative-level operating system access on the router. With this access, you can re-enable OpenVPN server as well as disable CWMP and other Administrative tasks restricted from the Web Portal.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- "Admin" Access to an Archer TP-Link V1/V2 router. (Hint: default credentials are admin:admin)
- Proper authorization to test the vulnerability on the router.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/StanleyJobsonAU/LongBow.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd LongBow
```
3. Browse via web browser to your Admin Web Portal (e.g. 192.168.1.1:80)
4. Login with default admin credentials
5. Once logged in, retrieve the "JSESSIONID" cookie (F12 -> Storage -> Cookies -> JSESSIONID) and note it down.
6. Run the script with the following syntax:

```
python CVE-2023-31756-LongBow.py --ip [IP of router] --session [JSESSIONID Cookie]
Example: python CVE-2023-31756-LongBow.py --ip 192.168.1.1 --session b3223de242cb163b0ab3557f859d14
```

7. If successful, a root level shell will be available on port 23. Use telnet to connect (e.g. telnet 192.168.1.1 23)
